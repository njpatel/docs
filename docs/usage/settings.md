## Token

**Obtain a token in the Axiom UI**

You can generate an ingest and personal token manually in your Axiom user settings. 

The ingest token is to used to send data to one or more datasets. Ingest tokens do not allow control of your organization, they are only used to ingest events, while the Personal token is used to access the Axiom API programmatically for custom integrations or for tools such as the Axiom CLI.

## API

The best way to get started with our API is to use [Go-Axiom](https://github.com/axiomhq/cli) to send events directly to Axiom. 

## Dataset 

Manage datasets for your organization, including creating new datasets or deleting existing datasets.

**Datasets are a collection of similar events** When data is sent to Axiom it is stored in a dataset. 

Dataset names must be between 1-128 characters, and may only contain ASCII alphanumeric characters and the '-' character.

To create a dataset, enter the **name** and **description** of your dataset.

- How much data you can ingest. 
- How long can you use your Instance.
- Maximum Datasets you can have.
- Maximum number of Users.
- Maximum number of Teams. 
- Maximum Query Window.

## Manage Teams

You can view, create, and manage teams.  Team members added can also manage access to datasets. 

If youâ€™re a team Owner, you can add new team members to the team by selecting the **Add button** at the upper right corner omn the Axiom UI.   

- Enter the name of the user you want to add as a member. 

- Search for the team member you want to add to your Team.

**Only users with the roles User or Read Only can be added as team members. Once a user is added to one or more teams, they can only see the datasets that are visible to those teams.**

## User Settings

After signing up, you can control the access to your Axiom deployments by managing the user's list.  **Settings > Users.** 

Team owners can add a user's name, email, and also assign a specific role.
